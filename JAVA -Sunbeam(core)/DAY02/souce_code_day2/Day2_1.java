// println() method is non static method of PrintStream class 
// to call println() we need object of PrintStream class
// since we know , we wish to print the data on output screen
// so , "out" is a field which deals with output stream

// "out" field declaration is present in System class statically
// static PrintStream out;

// so to call println() 
// we shall use out.println()
// but out is declared statically inside System class
// so we have to write it.
// System.out.println()
