      <p>In the heart of the forest,
      <br>
      Where the trees stand tall and proud,
      <br>
      There's a secret that's waiting to be found.
      <br>
      It's a whisper that echoes through the wood.
      <br>
      It's a melody that sings in the breeze.
      <br>
      It's a story that's told by the leaves.
      <br>
      Come and listen, my friend,
      <br>
      To the secrets of nature's blend.</p>
